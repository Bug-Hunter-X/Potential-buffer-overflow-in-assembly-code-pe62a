This repository contains an example of a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in assembly code. The bug is caused by adding 10 to a value that may be close to the stack boundary. This can cause the code to overwrite other data on the stack, leading to unpredictable behavior or crashes. The solution shows how to check for potential buffer overflows before performing the addition.  The solution demonstrates safe memory handling practices.
